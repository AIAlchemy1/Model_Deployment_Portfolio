## Introduction

In this portfolio, you'll find detailed examples and implementations showcasing my ability to deploy machine learning models. These projects demonstrate my skills in not only training models but also in preparing them for real-world applications through efficient serialization, updates, and containerization.

## Projects

### Pickle & Joblib

- **Model Serialization**: Demonstrated the use of Pickle and Joblib for serializing and deserializing machine learning models, enabling their storage and easy distribution for future predictions.

### Updatable Classifiers

- **Dynamic Learning**: Showcased the implementation of machine learning classifiers that can be updated with new data over time, ensuring the model stays relevant and improves without complete retraining.

### Docker Containerization

- **Model Deployment with Docker**: Illustrated the process of containerizing machine learning models using Docker, facilitating easy deployment to various environments while ensuring consistency and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pickle
- Joblib
- Docker
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
